# Tic-Tac-Toe

A tic tac toe web application I have created for my Interapt/General Assembly Java and Software Engineering Immersive course.

## How I worked on this project

- I built this app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- I created user stories to deteremine what functions I needed for the application
- I used other tic tac toe websites as reference to how I wanted my tic tac toe to look like such as [Play Tic Tac Toe](https://playtictactoe.org/)

## User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page
- Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win, lose and tie counter
- Involve Audio in your game
- Get inventive with your styling e.g. use hover effects or animations

## Project Specifications

- Light Mode and Dark Mode toggle switch
- Scoreboard System
- Sound effects included
- Winning System

## If I had more time I would change this

- I would try to work more on my media queries to make the tic tac toe app more responsiveness
- Add more animations
